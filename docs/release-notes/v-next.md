## NewHeap.Platform.AI.Chat.AspNet: a host with only chat-only agents follows the run configuration

This adds to the 22.0.0 note on chat-only agents (`run.ChatOnly()`); nothing changes. A host whose only
agents with run settings are chat-only still loads the run configuration defined as data when it
starts and checks its stamp every 30 seconds (`NhAssistantRunConfigurationRefresh`, a hosted service,
not a background operation). A chat turn does not check the stamp, so this is how the agent's skills
defined as data come into effect and follow changes made on another host.

## NewHeap.Platform.AI.Common, NewHeap.Platform.AI.Chat and NewHeap.Platform.AI.Chat.AspNet: agent work stays in the caller's tenant

Every path that reaches agent work now applies the tenant rule that the proposal and run reads already
applied: a thread, run, proposal or subject of another tenant than the caller's reads as unknown, and
the whole application reaches only callers without a tenant or of the `UseSingleTenant` tenant. The
subject access resolver gets no tenant, so a person whose actor id holds roles in several tenants no
longer reaches another tenant's agent work with a sign-in for this one. Forgetting a deleted subject
can now name its scope, so an equal id of another tenant or division keeps its threads. Hosts without
tenants, and hosts whose resolver describes each subject in the tenant its people sign in with, see no
change.

| Breaking change | Required action |
|---|---|
| The routes by id (`GET threads/{id}/runs`, `consultations`, `proposals`, `memory`, `artifacts` and an artifact's content, `POST runs/{runId}/cancel` and `retry`), deciding one or several proposals, `resolve`, `feedback`, `INhAssistantProposalDecisionService` and `GET conversations/{id}` answer a thread of another tenant `404` before they record a participant. | Describe each subject with the tenant its people sign in with (`NhAiSubjectInfo.TenantId`). |
| `GET threads`, `POST threads/open` and `threads/start`, `GET subjects/{type}/{id}/work` and `agents` answer a subject of another tenant `404 assistant-subject-not-found`; `POST subjects/{type}/summary` counts it zero. | None; treat the `404` like an unknown subject. |
| `POST threads/start` answers an unknown subject `404 assistant-subject-not-found`, also for a caller without a role, instead of `403 assistant-subject-access-denied`. | Treat both `404` and `403` as "cannot start here". |
| `GET approvals/inbox` (flat and grouped) and `INhAssistantProposalCounts` list only proposals of threads in the caller's tenant. | Pass the person's tenant in `NhAssistantDecidingPerson.TenantId`. |
| The consult and request tools refuse a subject of another tenant than the asker's, and the whole application for an asker bound to a tenant that takes no part in it, with `assistant-consult-subject-unavailable`. | None. |
| `INhAssistantSubjectWork.GetAsync` and `SummarizeAsync` with an actor id and a principal are obsolete: they compare no tenant. | Call `GetAsync(subject, new NhAssistantDecidingPerson(user, actorId, tenantId), agentId)` and `SummarizeAsync(subjectType, subjectIds, person)`; an implementation of the interface adds both. |
| `INhAiSubjectRetention.ForgetSubjectAsync(subject)` is obsolete: it forgets the id in every tenant and division. | Read the subject's scope key (`NhAiSubjectInfo.ScopeKey`) before the delete and call `ForgetSubjectAsync(subject, scopeKey)`; an implementation of the interface adds the overload. |
