## NewHeap.Platform.AI.Chat.AspNet: request delegates generated at build time

The library builds with ASP.NET Core's Request Delegate Generator (`EnableRequestDelegateGenerator`), so
the request delegates of the assistant's 139 minimal API endpoints are written when the package is built.
A host that calls `MapNewHeapAssistant` no longer compiles them with `RequestDelegateFactory` while it
starts. Applications change nothing.

Measured with `AssistantRequestDelegateTests.Measure_mapping_and_building_the_assistant_endpoints`
(`NH_MEASURE_ENDPOINTS=1`, Release, Windows 11, Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX, .NET 10.0.12): the time of
`MapNewHeapAssistant` plus the first read of every endpoint, for 20 hosts in one process after three
warm-up hosts, and for the first host of the process. The ranges cover four runs before and five after;
the first host was recorded in two and four of them.

| Per host | Before | After |
|---|---:|---:|
| Wall-clock time, median | 225–231 ms | 6.5–7.0 ms |
| Process CPU time, mean | 248–270 ms | 6–11 ms |
| First host of the process, wall-clock time | 270–271 ms | 91–95 ms |

Routes, endpoint names, summaries, `Produces` metadata, tags, filters, authorization, the binding of
route and query values (a malformed value still answers 400) and the 404 of a disabled assistant are
unchanged; the sample's OpenAPI document is the same. The endpoints' metadata now also holds the
generator's `GeneratedCodeAttribute`, and the generator's `IParameterBindingMetadata` reports
`HasTryParse` false for `string` parameters, which need no parsing.

| None. | None. |
