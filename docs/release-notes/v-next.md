## NewHeap.Platform.AI.Chat.AspNet: a host with only chat-only agents follows the run configuration

This adds to the 22.0.0 note on chat-only agents (`run.ChatOnly()`); nothing changes. A host whose only
agents with run settings are chat-only still loads the run configuration defined as data when it
starts and checks its stamp every 30 seconds (`NhAssistantRunConfigurationRefresh`, a hosted service,
not a background operation). A chat turn does not check the stamp, so this is how the agent's skills
defined as data come into effect and follow changes made on another host.

## NewHeap.Platform.AspNet.Common: inherited writes stay in the controller's scope

`DoUpdate` and `DoUpdatePartial` of `DbEntityProtectedNhBaseController` and
`CompositeDbEntityProtectedNhBaseController` first resolve the row through the controller's
`GetQueryableAsync`, as `DoDelete` already did, and return `404 Not Found` outside it without calling
the service. A scope filter there, such as the active-division filter of the division controllers,
now bounds writes as well as reads. Without the division access-all permission,
`NhBaseDivisionUserController.Create` and `Update` return `403 Forbidden` for a body whose
`DivisionId` is not the active division, and `NhBaseDivisionController.Create` returns `403` because
a new division lies outside the active division. The sample manages the memberships of Sample North
under `/division-memberships` (SPM-211).

| Breaking change | Required action |
|---|---|
| An update or partial update of a row outside `GetQueryableAsync`, including an id that does not exist, returns `404` instead of reaching the service (which answered `400` for an unknown id). | None, unless a client or test expected `400` for an unknown id or wrote rows that its own reads exclude; widen `GetQueryableAsync` or write through a custom action that checks access itself. |
| `NhBaseDivisionUserController.Create` and `Update` return `403` for a body that names another division than the active one, unless the caller has the division access-all permission. | None, unless a division manager adds members to other divisions; grant the access-all permission or override the action. |
| `NhBaseDivisionController.Create` returns `403` unless the caller has the division access-all permission. | Grant the division access-all permission to the people who add divisions, or override `Create` with the application's own check. |

## NewHeap.Platform.AspNet.Common: a locked-out division membership grants nothing

`NhUserManager.GetValidClaimsByUserIdAsync` counts only the user's own division memberships that
are not locked out. A membership is locked out from the day its `LockOutStartDateTime` is reached
through the day of its `LockOutEndDateTime`, or indefinitely without an end date, as
`IsBlockedAsync` treats account lockout. Before, another member's row or a lockout without an end
date could keep the division, and its roles were loaded without a lockout check. Issued tokens and
the claims that division policies, `HasDivisionAccessAsync` and `INhDivisionAccess` reload per
request now leave out the locked-out division.

| Breaking change | Required action |
|---|---|
| A member whose division membership is locked out gets no claims for that division until the lockout ends, also when the division has other members or the lockout has no end date. | None, unless an application relied on locked-out members keeping access; end or remove the lockout instead. Tokens issued before the update keep their claims until they expire, while division policies deny at once. |
